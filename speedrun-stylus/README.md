# Speedrun Stylus

> A challenge-based onboarding platform helping Rust and Web2 developers level up their Web3 skills through practical Stylus smart contract challenges.

## üåü Overview

Speedrun Stylus is an interactive learning platform inspired by Speedrun Ethereum, specifically designed for developers who want to master Arbitrum Stylus development. Through curated challenges, GitHub integration, and on-chain verification, developers can build real skills while earning verifiable achievements.

**üîó Live Platform:** [https://speedrunstylus.com](https://speedrunstylus.com)

## üöÄ Quick Start: First 5 Challenges

- **Prerequisites**: Install Docker Desktop and ensure the engine is running. Pull the image `abxglia/speedrun-stylus:0.1` (see the Docker guide). Generate a GitHub PAT with all scopes.

  - Docker guide: [docker/README.md](../docker/README.md)
  - PAT guide: [github/PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN.md](../github/PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN.md)

- **For each challenge (1‚Äì5)**:

  - Create a new folder ‚Üí open in VS Code/Cursor
  - Clone the correct branch for your chosen challenge using the commands here: [Clone commands ‚Üí Step 1](../docker/README.md#step-1-clone-the-repository-for-your-challenge)
  - Place these two scripts in the ROOT of your challenge folder (reused for all challenges):
    - Setup + run: [powershell-7/speedrun.ps1](../powershell-7/speedrun.ps1)
    - Submit (3x): [github-push/speedrun_submissions.ps1](../github-push/speedrun_submissions.ps1)
  - Run setup script: [powershell-7/speedrun.ps1](../powershell-7/speedrun.ps1)
  - Verify app at http://localhost:3000/
  - Submit 3 times with: [github-push/speedrun_submissions.ps1](../github-push/speedrun_submissions.ps1) (run from project ROOT)
  - Already have a cloned repo? Use: [powershell7-readme-automation/speedrun_readme_steps.ps1](../powershell7-readme-automation/speedrun_readme_steps.ps1)
